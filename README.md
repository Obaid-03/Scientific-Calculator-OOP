This project is a Scientific Calculator implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The calculator provides a variety of mathematical operations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex number operations, binary conversions, polynomial arithmetic, and more. The design is structured with multiple classes, each responsible for specific types of operations or number systems, ensuring modularity and scalability.

Key Features:
Numbers Class: Handles basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Fraction Class: Supports operations on fractions, such as simplification, addition, and comparison.
Complex Class: Manages complex numbers and performs complex arithmetic.
Polynomial Class: Provides functionalities to work with polynomials, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication of polynomials.
Bigint Class: Supports operations with large integers, allowing calculations beyond standard data types.
Binary Class: Converts numbers to binary and performs binary arithmetic.
Operation Class: Contains advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, and factorial operations.
This project demonstrates a clean separation of concerns and the use of inheritance and encapsulation in designing a robust scientific calculator.



How to Run the Scientific Calculator
To run the calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub. You can use the following command:


git clone https://github.com/Obaid-03/Scientific-Calculator-OOP.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change the directory to where the repository was cloned:


cd scientific-calculator
Compile the Source Code: The project is written in C++, so youâ€™ll need a C++ compiler. If you have g++ installed, you can compile the project by running:

g++ -o calculator main.cpp



Run the Executable: After successful compilation, an executable file called calculator will be created. You can run it with:


./calculator

Using the Calculator: Once the program starts, you can follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations such as:

Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Operations on complex numbers, fractions, and polynomials
Binary arithmetic
Advanced functions like trigonometry, logarithms, and factorials
